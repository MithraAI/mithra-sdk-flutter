/// Push-notification bridge, reached through `Narya.push`.
///
/// There are two ways to get a device token into the SDK, and a host uses
/// exactly **one** of them per platform:
///
/// * **iOS, no Firebase** - call [registerForRemoteNotifications]. The plugin
///   requests notification permission, registers with APNs natively and
///   delivers the hex token on [onToken] *and* to the native SDK by itself, the
///   same way the native `narya-ios` demo does. This is the Iterable-style
///   path: nothing else is needed.
/// * **`firebase_messaging`** (Android always; iOS optionally) - the host
///   obtains the token from Firebase and hands it to [setToken]. Firebase
///   stays out of this plugin's dependency graph.
///
/// Rendering is split by platform. On Android, Mithra sends **data-only** FCM
/// messages, so the system posts nothing on its own: the host hands every
/// message from `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` and `onBackgroundMessage` to
/// [handlePushMessage], and the native SDK renders the notification (title,
/// body, image, action buttons, channel) exactly as it does for a native
/// `FirebaseMessagingService`. On iOS rich pushes need a native Notification
/// Service Extension target linking `MithraAnalyticsNotificationService`; that
/// is documented in the README rather than bridged.

  /// iOS: requests notification permission and registers with APNs natively.
  ///
  /// The plugin asks `UNUserNotificationCenter` for authorization with the
  /// given options. When permission is granted - or was already granted or
  /// provisionally granted - it calls
  /// `UIApplication.registerForRemoteNotifications()` on the main thread. The
  /// resulting APNs token is delivered on [onToken] as a lowercase hex string
  /// and passed to the native SDK (`setPushToken`) without any host code; a
  /// token that arrives before `Narya.initialize` completes is queued and
  /// applied on initialization, so this may be called first. A failure is
  /// reported on [onRegistrationError].
  ///
  /// The plugin also **always** installs itself as the
  /// `UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate` (delegate chaining): it
  /// becomes the delegate and forwards every callback to whatever was
  /// installed before - the default `FlutterAppDelegate`, a host object, or a
  /// plugin such as `firebase_messaging`, which registers its own delegate on
  /// iOS even when you only use it for Android. Neither of those forwards
  /// `willPresent` / `didReceive(response:)` to this plugin, so without the
  /// takeover foreground pushes would show no banner and would not be tracked.
  /// As delegate the plugin shows foreground pushes, tracks Mithra ones
  /// (`push_delivered`) and routes taps to [onPushOpened] /
  /// [takeInitialPushPayload] (`push_opened`, with the tapped action); the
  /// previous delegate then receives the same callback (`willPresent` options
  /// are merged, and it owns the completion of `didReceive`), so its behaviour
  /// is preserved. A debug line names the chained class. The delegate is
  /// installed synchronously, before the permission round trip, so call this
  /// early (before or right after `Narya.initialize`) to capture a cold-start
  /// tap; a tap that arrives before initialization is replayed afterwards.
  ///
  /// Call this only if you want the Narya SDK to own APNs registration on iOS.
  /// If `firebase_messaging` should keep owning it, do not call this; feed
  /// [setToken] from `FirebaseMessaging.instance.getAPNSToken()` /
  /// `getToken()` instead and track taps with [trackOpened]. Never combine the
  /// two token paths on the same platform.

  ///
  /// ## Rule
  ///
  /// Three payload levels are inspected independently, exactly as the native
  /// SDKs do: the top-level keys, the `CustomData` value (a `Map`, or a JSON
  /// string decoding to an object) and the `mithra` envelope value (likewise a
  /// `Map` or a JSON string decoding to an object). The payload is a Mithra
  /// push when **any** level satisfies **any** of these:
  ///
  /// 1. `tracking` is present and non-empty: a non-empty string or a non-empty
  ///    map. Any other non-null value (a number, a boolean, a list) counts as
  ///    present too.
  /// 2. `inapp_sync` is truthy: `true`, a non-zero number, or one of the
  ///    strings `"true"`, `"1"`, `"yes"` compared case-insensitively and
  ///    **without** trimming (`" yes "` is not truthy).
  /// 3. `mithra_message_id` is a non-empty string.
  /// 4. The top-level `mithra` key holds an object: a `Map`, or a string that
  ///    decodes to a JSON object. `{}` counts; a bare string such as `"yes"`, a
  ///    number, a list or malformed JSON does not.
  ///
  /// Because each level is checked on its own, a blank marker at one level
  /// never masks a valid one at another. Whitespace is significant: `"   "` is
  /// a non-empty `tracking`. A `mithra` map nested inside `CustomData` is not
  /// the envelope and is not descended into.
  ///
  /// A bare `message_id` (or the `gcm.message_id` Firebase adds to every
  /// message) is deliberately **not** enough: those keys are not specific to
  /// Mithra. The key names come from gwaihir's push payload contract
  /// (`gwaihir/docs/push-payload-contract.md`), which both native SDKs and this
  /// predicate implement identically; the parity table is in
  /// `docs/api-contract.md`.
