/// call for call, the native `Analytics.setBadgeCount(_:completion:)` /

/// `UNUserNotificationCenter.setBadgeCount(_:withCompletionHandler:)` on
/// iOS 16+, and the deprecated `UIApplication.applicationIconBadgeNumber` on
/// iOS 15. Delegating to the native methods is a follow-up - the same
/// arrangement `NaryaPushGate` uses for `isNaryaPush`.
///
/// No SDK calls and no state: this is pure platform plumbing.
