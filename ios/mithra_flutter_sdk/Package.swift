// swift-tools-version: 5.9
// The Swift Package Manager path for the mithra_flutter_sdk Flutter plugin.
//
// Flutter looks for a plugin's Swift package at
// ios/<plugin_name>/Package.swift with a target named <plugin_name>, which is
// why this file lives one directory below ios/.
//
// This path resolves the Narya iOS SDK through its hosted Swift package rather
// than vendoring a binary. The CocoaPods path
// (../mithra_flutter_sdk.podspec) downloads and verifies the prebuilt XCFramework
// instead. Both pin the SDK to one exact version: the bridge reproduces SDK
// internals it cannot yet call (see NaryaPushGate), so a floating upper bound
// would let a minor SDK release change behaviour underneath it. Bump the
// version here and in the podspec's `narya_sdk_version` together.
