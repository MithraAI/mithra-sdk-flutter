# CocoaPods spec for the mithra_flutter_sdk plugin.
#
# Run `pod lib lint mithra_flutter_sdk.podspec` to validate before publishing.
#
# The Narya iOS SDK is not published as a pod, so this spec vendors the
# prebuilt XCFramework from https://sdk.mithra.com/ios/. `prepare_command`
# downloads the pinned versioned archive, verifies it against the release's
# checksum file, and unpacks it into ios/Frameworks/ (which is gitignored).
#
# Flutter also supports Swift Package Manager for plugins; see
# ios/mithra_flutter_sdk/Package.swift for that path, which resolves the SDK through
# the hosted Swift package instead of a vendored binary.
